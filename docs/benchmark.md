# Performance Benchmarks

The official benchmarking suite for Gojinn has moved to a dedicated repository to ensure reproducible results and isolate load testing tools from the core codebase.

The suite includes comparisons against:
* **Docker (Native Go)**
* **Gojinn (TinyGo)**
* **Gojinn (Rust)** - *Sub-millisecond latency*
